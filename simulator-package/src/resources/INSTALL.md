# Installation
## Prerequisites

### Java 7

This service makes use of the Java 7 runtime. The runtime can be downloaded
from the Oracle Homepage. I recommend downloading the complete JDK from

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Groovy

In addition to the JDK the Groovy scripting language needs to be available. At
lease version 2.1 is needed. It can be downloaded from

http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download
